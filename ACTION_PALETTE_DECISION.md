# Action Palette Argument Handling Decision

## Summary

For the "Action Palette with Arguments" feature, we've decided to use a **dialog-box-based approach (Option 3)** as the primary interaction pattern.

## Reasoning

This decision was made with future scalability and maintainability in mind. As we add more actions, a dialog-based system offers several key advantages:

1.  **Scalability & Consistency:** A single, reusable dialog component can be dynamically configured for any action, regardless of the number or type of parameters it requires (e.g., text, dates, dropdowns). This creates a consistent and predictable user experience.
2.  **Maintainability:** Adding new actions is simplified. We only need to define the required parameters, and the generic dialog framework handles the UI generation and data collection. This avoids the need to build custom UI for every new action.
3.  **Flexibility:** The dialog pattern can gracefully handle everything from simple, single-field inputs to complex, multi-step forms without cluttering the main interface.

## Alternative Considered

-   **Inline Cards:** While good for very simple, single-parameter actions, this approach is not scalable. It would lead to either a proliferation of custom components or overly complex rendering logic as more actions are added. They may be considered later as a "quick action" enhancement for specific high-frequency tasks, but not as the primary system.
-   **Rich Text Field:** This was deemed overly complex and likely to create a confusing user experience.

By adopting a dialog-first approach, we are building a robust framework that can easily accommodate future growth.
