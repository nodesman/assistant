# Journal Feature - Codebase Separation Notes

## Objective

This document clarifies the relationship between the journaling feature being developed and the existing "Kai" AI coding assistant codebase (`kai/`).

## Key Points

1.  **Independent Codebase:** The journaling feature is being built as a **completely separate and independent codebase**. It will reside in its own directory structure, distinct from the `kai/` directory.
2.  **No Modification to Kai:** There will be **no modifications** made to the files within the `kai/` directory (`kai/src`, `kai/bin`, `kai/docs`, etc.) as part of developing this journaling feature.
3.  **Kai as Inspiration Only:** The existing Kai codebase serves solely as a **source of inspiration and reference** for potential architectural patterns, workflow ideas (like the AI reflection loop), and command-line interface design. We are *porting concepts*, not code, and adapting them specifically for the journaling use case.
4.  **Dedicated Tool:** The resulting journaling tool will be a standalone CLI application, callable independently. While inspired by Kai's workflow, it will have its own configuration, dependencies, and execution logic focused purely on journaling.
5.  **Integration Context:** This journaling tool is intended as one component within a larger, custom-built personal task management system. Its separation from Kai is deliberate to maintain modularity within that larger system.

## Development Approach

-   New files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, `config/`, etc.) will be created in the current working directory (or a designated new project directory, *not* `kai/`).
-   Dependencies will be managed separately via the new `package.json`.
-   Configuration (like the journal storage path, AI settings) will be handled by a dedicated configuration file for the journaling tool.
